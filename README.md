Baby steps, first time programming.


Hi! 

I have no idea if anyone is going to read this, but this is actually my first time programming. I feel the adrenaline rushing in already, I'm definitely gonna love coding. Anyway, I'm sure I'll make many many mistakes along the way, but that's how we learn. 

Sadly, I'm gonna have to cut this short because I got learning to do. Gotta go order my first book on Amazon called "Python Crash Course". I really believe this book will be a good introduction for me, and I'll go on r/learnpython and look up more resources while I wait for the book to arrive. 

I'll see you all later! Wish me luck, this is a journey I never planned on taking but excited to!

Sincerely,

Berkay AKCAKIL
